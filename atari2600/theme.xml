			<text>Credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, the Atari 2600 is an 8-bit second generation home video game console created by Atari, Inc. First released in North America in 1977 as the Atari VCS (Video Computer System), the console initially had slow sells, partially due to the small variety of games, but innovation in game designs, including computer-controlled opponents and the introduction of the graphical adventure game genre, and licensing of popular arcade hits such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man would make it the definitive leader of the generation. The Atari 2600 would sell 30 million units worldwide.</text>
