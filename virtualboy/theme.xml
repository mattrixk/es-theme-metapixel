			<text>The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit fifth generation table-top 3D video game console first released by Nintendo in Japan in 1995. Impressed by Reflection Technology, Inc.'s 3D stereoscopic head-tracking protoype, Nintendo licensed the technology, but ongoing health and liability concerns in Japan led Nintendo to forgo head-tracking and focus on a table-top experience. With a highly publicized launch, the Virtual Boy was overwhelmingly panned by critics for its high price and discomfort while playing. A poor marketing campaign would also contribute to the Virtual Boy's commercial failure, selling only 770,000 units. It was quietly discontinued.</text>
